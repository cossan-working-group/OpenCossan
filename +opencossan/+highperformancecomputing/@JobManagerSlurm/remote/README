This folder contains a number of files to allow Parallel Computing Toolbox
to be used with Slurm via the generic cluster interface.

The files in this folder assume that the client and cluster share a file system
and that the client is not able to submit directly to the cluster using the
sbatch command.

Note that all the files in this directory will work only for clusters that are
running on UNIX.

1) Instructions for Use
=======================
On the Slurm cluster
--------------------
Enable job accounting on the Slurm cluster.
This allows the sacct command to run.
The scripts use the sacct output to track the state of Slurm jobs.

Read the documentation for using the generic cluster interface with
the Parallel Computing Toolbox and familiarize yourself with the different
properties that can be set for a generic cluster.

In the MATLAB Client
--------------------
1. Create a generic cluster object for your cluster. Set the IntegrationScriptsLocation
to this folder. For independent jobs, independentSubmitFcn is used as your 
submit function. For communicating jobs, communicatingSubmitFcn is used as 
your submit function.
Both of these functions require one character vector value field on the cluster's AdditionalProperties property
    a. ClusterHost - The name of the cluster host that will call the sbatch command.

Example:
% Use a folder that both the client and cluster can access
% as the JobStorageLocation.  If your cluster and client use
% different operating systems, you should specify JobStorageLocation
% to be a structure.  Refer to the documentation on
% generic cluster for more information.
cluster = parallel.cluster.Generic('JobStorageLocation', '/home/JOB_STORAGE_LOCATION');
set(cluster, 'HasSharedFilesystem', true);
set(cluster, 'IntegrationScriptsLocation', '<INSTALLATION_DIR>/parallel/slurm/remote');
set(cluster, 'ClusterMatlabRoot', '/apps/matlab');
set(cluster, 'OperatingSystem', 'unix');
% Define the cluster host that will be used for job submission
cluster.AdditionalProperties.ClusterHost = 'myHost1';

2. Create a job and some tasks, submit the job, and wait for it to finish before
getting the results. Do the same for communicating jobs if required.

The first time you submit a job to the cluster from any client MATLAB session
you will be prompted to provide your username and other credential information for the
cluster host that will submit the job.  If you choose to use an identity file, this must
be an ssh identity file.

If you need to change your credentials, reset them using the following command
in the MATLAB command window:
    cluster.UserData.RemoteConnection.disconnect

You will be prompted to provide your credentials again when you next submit a job.

As an alternative to these steps, create a profile that defines the appropriate
properties and run profile validation to verify that the profile
works correctly.


2) Description of Files
=======================
For more detail about these files, refer to the help and comments contained in the files themselves.

MATLAB Functions Required for generic cluster
----------------------------------------------
independentSubmitFcn.m
    Submit function for independent jobs.  Used as the IndependentSubmitFcn for your generic cluster object.
communicatingSubmitFcn.m
    Submit function for communicating jobs.  Used as the CommunicatingSubmitFcn for your generic cluster object.
deleteJobFcn.m
    Delete a job on the cluster.  Used as the DeleteJobFcn for your generic cluster object.
getJobStateFcn.m
    Get the job state from the cluster.  Used as the GetJobStateFcn for your generic cluster object.

Other MATLAB Functions
-----------------------
extractJobId.m
    Get the cluster's job ID from the submission output.
getSubmitString.m
    Get the submission string for the cluster.
createSubmitScript.m
    Create a script that is executed on the cluster host to perform job submission.
getRemoteConnection.m
    Get or create a parallel.cluster.RemoteClusterAccess connection.  If a new connection
    is created, this function prompts for user credentials either through standard
    MATLAB dialogs or the command line. It stores the connection in the UserData property of
    the cluster object.  If you provide incorrect credentials, you can reset them
    using the following code:
        >> cluster.UserData.RemoteConnection.disconnect();

    Refer to the MATLAB help for parallel.cluster.RemoteClusterAccess for more information.

Executable Scripts
-------------------
independentJobWrapper.sh
    Script used by the cluster to launch the MATLAB worker processes for independent jobs.
communicatingJobWrapper.sh
    Script used by the cluster to launch the MATLAB worker processes for communicating jobs.


3) Optional Customizations
==========================
The code customizations listed in this section are clearly marked in the relevant files.

independentSubmitFcn.m
----------------------
independentSubmitFcn provides the ability to supply additional submit arguments to the
sbatch command.  Modify the AdditionalProperties.AdditionalSubmitArgs
property to include additional submit arguments that are appropriate to your cluster.
For more information, refer to the sbatch documentation provided with your cluster.

communicatingSubmitFcn.m
------------------------
communicatingSubmitFcn calculates the number of nodes to request from the cluster from the
NumWorkersRange property of the communicating job.  Customize the number of
nodes requested to suit your cluster's requirements.

communicatingSubmitFcn provides the ability to supply additional submit arguments to the
sbatch command.  Modify the AdditionalProperties.AdditionalSubmitArgs
property to include additional submit arguments that are appropriate to your cluster.
For more information, refer to the sbatch documentation provided with your cluster.

communicatingJobWrapper.sh
--------------------------
communicatingJobWrapper.sh uses the StrictHostKeyChecking=no and UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null options
for ssh.  Customize the ssh options to suit your cluster's requirements.  For
more information, refer to your operating system's ssh documentation.

getRemoteConnection.m
---------------------
getRemoteConnection.m uses either standard MATLAB dialogs or command line input to request
credentials from users.  You may wish to provide default credentials or modify the manner
in which the credential information is requested.
