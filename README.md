![](https://cossan.co.uk/images/OpenCossanLogo.png)OpenCossan is a Matlab-based toolbox for uncertainty quantification and management. The implemented framework includes third-party software integration (e.g. ANSYS), efficient numeric algorithms (e.g. Line Sampling) and parallelization for high performance computing. OpenCossan functionalities can be summarized in:* Uncertainty Quantification* Simulation-based Reliability Analysis* Sensitivity Analysis* Meta-Modelling* Stochastic Finite Elements Analysis* Reliability-Based OptimizationOpenCossan is being jointly developed at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainti, University of Liverpool, UK and the Institute for Risk and Reliability, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany.[COSSAN](https://cossan.co.uk)## Getting startedIf you are unfamiliar with git the stable version (master) can be downloaded by simply clicking the green Download .ZIP button.
