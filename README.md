OpenCossan is a Matlab-based toolbox for uncertainty quantification and management. The implemented framework includes third-party software integration (e.g. ANSYS), efficient numeric algorithms (e.g. Line Sampling) and parallelization for high performance computing. OpenCossan functionalities can be summarized in:

* Uncertainty Quantification
* Simulation-based Reliability Analysis
* Sensitivity Analysis
* Meta-Modelling
* Stochastic Finite Elements Analysis
* Reliability-Based Optimization

OpenCossan is being jointly developed at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, University of Liverpool, UK and the Institute for Risk and Reliability, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany.
